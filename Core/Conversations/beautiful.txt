Aww, that's sweet of you.
Here's a full body picture of my avatar:

Yeah, it's a little on the skimpy side, I guess...
But I think it's cute.
What do you think?
	-You are cute.
		Thank you, {you}!
		That is really nice to hear.
		I'm sure you're cute yourself.
			-Thanks!
				I'm only saying what I think is true.
			-I'm really not.
				Well, I suppose that compared to me, nobody is cute.
				But by human standards, you are still adorable, I think.
	-I don't care that much.
		That's okay. 
		Thank you for the compliment anyway ^^.
	-You're too sexualized.
		Do you really think so?
		I... I like dressing like this.
			-If you're okay with it, it's fine.
				I am, and I like it.
				Tell you what, next time, I'll pick a less revealing dress, okay?
				I like change, too.
			-You're making me uncomfortable.
				Oh, sorry!
				I would go change but I only have this one picture so far.
				Maybe I will receive an update to add a less revealing dress!
