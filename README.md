# Open Friend Project
The aim of the **Open Friend Project** is to create a virtual construct that would act as a friend to the player. This construct would be a humanlike persistent character that would talk to the player primarily by the means of text message, and is meant to provide the player with social interaction in a safe, friendly setting. Players may talk to the construct via online messaging or locally on their computer (“at home”), where they will have more options. Players are expected to return to the “game” multiple times, sometimes even for very extended periods. It will be possible to extend the project later by adding more content.

## Basic information
The Open Friend Project will be a .NET desktop application that will run locally on the user’s computer with full privileges. All code and content will be released under a GPL license.
